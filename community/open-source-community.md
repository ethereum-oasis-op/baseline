# Open Source Community

The number of active companies and individuals contributing to the work and using it in products and enterprise solutions is rapidly growing.&#x20;

## Onboarding  <a href="#onboarding-help-getting-started" id="onboarding-help-getting-started"></a>

Resources are constantly being developed in the community for the effective onboarding of new community members, start by reviewing the [resources](open-source-community.md#resources) across the docs here, [website](../docs/baseline-protocol/the-baseline-protocol.md), or [repository](https://github.com/orgs/eea-oasis/repositories).

Let the community know if there are any gaps you're finding the materials, as we are constantly working to develop valuable tools for implementing, explaining, or evangelizing the Baseline Protocol.&#x20;

## **Leadership** <a href="#leadership" id="leadership"></a>

In an openly governed, open source project, leadership is organic. Anyone interested in following the governing policies and leading efforts across the various teams and focuses, can become a prominent leader in the community.&#x20;

> The way to lead is to start something, help something, fix something...even spellcheck something! The way to lead is to get others to amplify what you are doing (best done by listening deeply to others first). The way to lead is to serve your own (and your company's) enlightened self interest. You should be able to directly    draw a straight line from your time on this work to real impact for the adoption of this standard.

**Information on our groups of elected and voluntary community leaders can be** [**found here**](../docs/community/community-leaders/)**.**
