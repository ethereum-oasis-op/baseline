# Open Source Community

The number of active companies and individuals contributing to the work and using it in products and enterprise solutions is rapidly growing.&#x20;

Our open source team members are the drivers of the development and adoption of Baseline and its Protocol. The work is active and always open to new members.

### **Resources**

The following resources provide more information about becoming a member:

* ****[**Get Involved**](https://www.baseline-protocol.org/get-involved/)**-** sign up and get involved in our open source teams
* [**Community Member Starter Kit**](https://www.baseline-protocol.org/resources/)**-** understand how you can contribute as a community member and how the open source community operates
* [**Slack**](https://join.slack.com/t/ethereum-baseline/shared\_invite/zt-d6emqeci-bjzBsXBqK4D7tBTZ40AEfQ)**-** join our community Slack, say hello, or ask a question
* ****[**Learn more**](https://www.baseline-protocol.org/resources/)- about the Baseline Protocol

## **Teams**

Baseline has 3 teams, and several focused working groups within each, where anyone can join and get involved in the efforts by [**signing up**](https://www.baseline-protocol.org/get-involved/)**.**&#x20;

> ### Baseline Core Devs
>
> Core Devs are the backbone of the Baseline open source community and have an active role in advancing the Baseline Protocol and/or related projects. Join the next generation of developers leading the rise of ubiquitous sync services to state machines everywhere.
>
> ### Outreach Team
>
> Outreach members communicate, advocate, and educate the world on the advantages of using and contributing to the protocol. Several working groups create enablement materials, devise industry-specific use cases, and document the significant work being done in the community. The Outreach Team is currently looking for members.
>
> ### Standards Team
>
> Members of the standards team work to define and contribute to the specifications of baseline compliance. The [Standards](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline-standard) are currently in the ratification process to become an official [Oasis Standard](https://www.oasis-open.org). The Standards Team has paused its work.

## Onboarding  <a href="#onboarding-help-getting-started" id="onboarding-help-getting-started"></a>

Resources are constantly being developed in the community for the effective onboarding of new community members, start by **reviewing the** [**resources**](open-source-community.md#resources) **across the docs here,** [**website**](../docs/baseline-protocol/the-baseline-protocol.md)**, or** [**repository**](https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-oasis-op/repositories)**.**

Let the community know if there are any gaps you're finding the materials, as we are constantly working to develop valuable tools for implementing, explaining, or evangelizing Baseline.&#x20;

## **Leadership** <a href="#leadership" id="leadership"></a>

In an openly governed, open source project, leadership is organic. Anyone interested in following the governing policies and leading efforts across the various teams and focuses, can become a prominent leader in the community.&#x20;

> The way to lead is to start something, help something, fix something...even spellcheck something! The way to lead is to get others to amplify what you are doing (best done by listening deeply to others first). The way to lead is to serve your own (and your company's) enlightened self interest. You should be able to directly draw a straight line from your time on this work to real impact for the adoption of this standard.

Information on our groups of elected and voluntary community leaders can be [**found here**](community-leaders.md)**.**
