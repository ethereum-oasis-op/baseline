  Anyone can contribute to Baseline by making technical,
  specification related, or other contributions
---

# Contributors

All technical and standards-related work of the Baseline initiative is maintained publicly on the [**github repo**](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline) **** and [**open source team**](open-source-community.md) work is managed in Google Drives by community managers. [**Sign up to join** the teams](open-source-community.md) or **email at baseline-team@oasis-open.org** for access to the open source team work.&#x20;

Anyone can get involved and start contributing by joining the open source teams, taking on work, proposing grant work, or even directly submitting an issue or PR to the repository.

There are four main ways to contribute:

* Write code (Architecture, Spikes, Issues, Tasks)
* Write specifications (Epics, Stories, Prioritizations, Use Cases)
* Write content and communicate it to more potential contributors, developers and product owners, and other stakeholders -- Join the [communications team](https://ethereum-baseline.slack.com/archives/C011NCZ2ES1) on Slack
* Help prioritize work and develop incentives to get it done by joining our [open source community teams](open-source-community.md#teams)

There is one other way to contribute, and it's the most important: **use the work in the Baseline Protocol to improve your own offerings**. The Baseline Protocol is not a product or platform..**the product is YOUR product**.

## Code of Conduct <a href="#code-of-conduct" id="code-of-conduct"></a>

Here is the link to the Baseline Protocol code of conduct:

{% embed url="https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md" %}

## Technical Contributors <a href="#technical-contributors" id="technical-contributors"></a>

Technical contributors either are working on architecture or developing code...but even correcting the language of documentation counts as a technical contribution and qualifies you to vote in upcoming [TSC](community-leaders.md#your-technical-steering-committee) elections.

## Core Developers <a href="#maintainers" id="maintainers"></a>

Once you've done some work as a Member, you may wish to become a **Maintainer** and have a direct hand in deciding what work is merged to the Main/Master Branch to become official Baseline technology and specifications.

### What do core developers do? <a href="#what-do-maintainers-do" id="what-do-maintainers-do"></a>

Core developers are people who take an active role in advancing the Baseline Protocol and/or related projects. They are primarily responsible for:

* Contributing code or contributing to specification work in the form of PRs that are linked to open and prioritized issues
* Reviewing and merging PRs into the master branch
* Cutting, testing, and releasing new versions of the related Baseline projects
* Working with the TSC and General Assembly to advance the Baseline Protocol

They can/should also contribute in the following ways:

* Writing epics and issues to guide development
* Setting up and supporting infrastructure (running demos, CI systems, community projects, etc...) that further Baseline
* Working with the community to help with adoption
* Presenting the project and key technologies to the public (in-person, webinar, videos, articles, etc...)

## How to become a maintainer? <a href="#how-to-become-a-maintainer" id="how-to-become-a-maintainer"></a>

There are two ways to become a maintainer: You are asked by a current maintainer, or you make request to an existing maintainer to become one.&#x20;

With either path you become a "provisional maintainer". As such you will need to show consistent contributions of code and/or specifications to the project. This can be in the form of pull requests that get merged into master. Or it can be in the form of technical specification, system architecture and related artifacts that guide the development activities of others.

All provisional core developers that focus on code development (over standards) must meet with the existing core developers and demonstrate they are capable of the following:

* Running the project locally
* Using the testing framework
* Explaining the components of the system architecture
* Walking through the code and explain the baseline process

Once the provisional maintainer demonstrates their capabilities, the existing core developers will vote during the next scheduled maintainer meeting to give the prospect full maintainer status. Members must vote with 2/3rds majority to add a maintainer. Voting that results in a tie or potentially other issue will be brought to the TSC for review.

## What is expected of core developers? <a href="#what-is-expected-of-maintainers" id="what-is-expected-of-maintainers"></a>

In general, a maintainer needs to:

* be an expert in one or more fields related to the project
* be an expert in finding and engaging the advice of other experts
* show commitment over time with multiple PRs merged
* be reliable in completing issues to which they have been assigned
* attend the weekly core developers meetings (with occasional absences allowed)
* demonstrate competency in software development or specification writing
* follow the project style and testing guidelines
* have a high degree of understanding of the project architecture
* be welcoming to others in the community who are using the project
* contribute in ways that substantially improve the quality of the project and the experience of people who use it
* follow branch, PR, and code style conventions

## How core developers organize? <a href="#how-maintainers-organize" id="how-maintainers-organize"></a>

### Slack <a href="#slack" id="slack"></a>

Core Developers meet and discuss issues virtually via the #maintainers slack room in the [baseline slack](https://ethereum-baseline.slack.com).

### Regular Meetings <a href="#weekly-meetings" id="weekly-meetings"></a>

There are currently no regular meetings.&#x20;

Meeting signups are maintained on the "Join the Community" page on https://baseline-protocol.org.

## How to stop being a maintainer? <a href="#how-to-stop-being-a-maintainer" id="how-to-stop-being-a-maintainer"></a>

Any of the following ways:

* You stop reviewing PR's, responding to messages, answering emails, and/or generally ghost the project.
* You are disrespectful towards anyone in the community and/or involved in the project.
* You are disruptive to the general process of maintaining the project, meetings, discussions, issues, or other.
* You notify the other core developers  you would like to relinquish your maintainer status.

Two-thirds of all current core developers constitute a quorum for a meeting involving a question of removal. A simple majority vote from core developers attending the meeting is required to remove a maintainer, but the TSC may be brought in to arbitrate if the maintainer to be removed or any other maintainer wishes to dispute the action. (See [Governance](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline/blob/main/docs/governance/governance.md) for details.)

### BLIPs

As of October 1, 2021, the baseline community will organize work in a similar fashion to Ethereum's EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposal). These will be called BaseLine Improvement Proposals, or BLIPs for short, and they will be maintained [here](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline-blips/issues). YOU ARE ENCOURAGED TO SUBMIT IDEAS to the BLIP repo, and we are well-organized to review and act on them in a timely fashion. You never know -- we might decide to raise a grant to pay for your idea to get executed. It's happened before. Try it out!

### Issues Organization and Community "Sprints" <a href="#issues-organization-and-community-sprints" id="issues-organization-and-community-sprints"></a>

Technical tasks are written as Github Issues. Issues will be reviewed, lightly prioritized, and communicated as "hey, help out here!" messaging to the developer community every two weeks. The TSC will periodically review what Issues and communications best succeeded in attracting help.

An Issue should be constructed, in particular, with acceptance tests. All other elements of a good Issue should be known to any practicing developer.

Most Issues should be attached to an Epic (see below).

A good Task/Issue starts with a Verb: "Implement xyz."

### Submitting a pull request <a href="#submitting-a-pull-request" id="submitting-a-pull-request"></a>

Follow these steps when submitting a pull request:

1. Fork the repo into your GitHub account. Read more about forking a repo on Github [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
2. Create a new branch, based on the `master` branch, with a name that concisely describes what you’re working on (ex. `add-mysql`).
3. Ensure that your changes do not cause any existing tests to fail.
4. Submit a pull request against the `main` branch.

Good practice strongly favors committing work frequently and not loading up a long period of work in isolation. Be brave...let others see what you are working on, even if it isn't "ready."

### eCLA and iCLA <a href="#ecla-and-icla" id="ecla-and-icla"></a>

Anyone can do a pull request and commit work to the community. In order for your work to be merged, you will need to sign the eCLA (entity contributor agreement) or iCLA (individual contributor agreement). Here are the details: [https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/projects/cla/projects-entity-cla](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/projects/cla/projects-entity-cla)​

The iCLA happens automatically when people submit a pull request, or they can access directly by going to [https://cla-assistant.io/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline](https://cla-assistant.io/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline)​

### Core Developers and Commit Rules <a href="#maintainers-and-commit-rules" id="maintainers-and-commit-rules"></a>

Merging to Master requires review by THREE Maintainers. The TSC seeded the initial set of Core Developers. Now, any active Member can [become a Maintainer](MAINTAINERS.md#how-to-become-a-maintainer). The Maintainers, collectively, may add more Maintainers by rough consensus, and the TSC may step in to resolve cases where this process fails.

## Specifications Contributors <a href="#specifications-contributors" id="specifications-contributors"></a>

The specifications work of the community can be done by anyone, both technical and non-technical contributors. The focus is on finding evidence for a requirement and articulating it in the form below.

### Epics and Stories Organization <a href="#epics-and-stories-organization" id="epics-and-stories-organization"></a>

The Baseline Protocol initiative uses [Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/baseline-5e713dc4f555144d9d6d17f6/roadmap) to create and manage both [specification](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline-standard) work and active protocol requirements and prioritization. (Zenhub should be a tab in your Github interface if you are using the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd?hl=en-US). There is also a web-app [here](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/baseline-5e713dc4f555144d9d6d17f6/roadmap).)

Zenhub enables Epics to nest, while Issues don't nest...not really. Therefore, the community will employ the practice of using Issues for engineering Tasks and Epics to contain high level topics, which may have nested within them a set of agile Epics, and in them a set of Stories, and even Stories may have other Stories nested in them. Engineering meets planning where a Story (in the form of a Zenhub Epic) is referenced by an Issue/Task. (This can work very well, but Zenhub's choice in calling Epics, _Epics_ can cause confusion.

### A Good Story <a href="#a-good-story" id="a-good-story"></a>

A Zenhub "Epic" used as a high-level container for a grouping of work should be in short topic form -- primarily nouns.

A Zenhub "Epic" used as a Story should almost always follow the form: "As X, I need Y so that I can Z." An acceptable variant is the "now I can" form (note the "so that" clause is preserved):

* A Party's System Administrator can look up Counterparties in an OrgRegistry (a public phone book) and add them to a Workgroup, so that they can start Baselining Records and Workflows.
* A Party's System Administrator can quickly and easily verify a Counterparty's identity found in the OrgRegistry, so that they can be confident in adding the Counterparty to a Workgroup.
* A Party's System Administrator can use some or all of the Counterparties and Workflow Steps defined in one Workgroup in Workflow Steps created within another Workgroup, so that Workgroups don't become yet another kind of silo.

## ​Contributors

The active contributors and maintainers of the Baseline repo can be found on [Github](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline/graphs/contributors). (Note: many contributors work in clones extending the protocol for their products. These people don't necessarily show up in the Github contributors list.)
