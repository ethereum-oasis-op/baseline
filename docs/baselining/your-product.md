# How to 'Baseline' Your Product

The Baseline Protocol isn't a product or a platform. It's a way for your product, your platform, your service to \[ \].

The Baseline Protocol presents significant commercial opportunities for solutions firms, enterprise systems vendors, and Cloud providers. Yorke Rhodes, Principal Program Manager, Blockchain at Microsoft said, “Microsoft Azure has been building production-ready offerings that give our enterprise customers direct access to blockchain technologies up and down the stack. For the Ethereum Mainnet we are imbuing enterprise cloud scale principles in the solution without compromising information security. Baseline is helping to create an opportunity for compelling solutions that can drive new value for enterprises while extending the value of the products our customers and partners have been using for years.”

It’s hoped that the providers of ERP, CRM and other enterprise systems will optimize their products for the protocol over time, but baselining works without requiring any modification to legacy systems.
