# Community Leaders

Over 500 people and companies signed up to be notified about the opening of the Baseline Protocol Github repository between March 4th and 19th, 2020. Over 300 of them also signed in as group members. The [members](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline/directory) represent many of the largest companies in the world, spanning several sectors. They also represent startups, students and talented individuals.

#### People listed here or appearing on community videos or in the github repos should be assumed to be representing themselves, and not necessarily the companies they work for.\* <a id="people-listed-here-or-appearing-on-community-videos-or-in-the-github-repos-should-be-assumed-to-be-representing-themselves-and-not-necessarily-the-companies-they-work-for"></a>

> \*\(In the mid-1990s, the [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29) community amassed thousands of developers from many companies before any of those companies officially sanctioned their involvement. Many of the companies participating in the Baseline Protocol initiative embrace the work, some already adding baselining to their strategic plans. But anyone observing someone's participation in the baseline community should assume that they do so as individuals. Please refrain from making assertions about the intentions of their employers.\)

### Bootstrapping Phase and Ongoing Phase <a id="bootstrapping-phase-and-ongoing-phase"></a>

The technical steering committee and the chair listed below were seated provisionally for six months, from From March 19, 2020 to September 31, 2020. This bootstrapping period ends when the active contributors to the repo \(anyone who has submitted a pull request that was merged to master in the preceeding period\) vote on the new TSC and chair. The specifications steering committee \(SSC\) has a variable number, and membership is based on whether one is named as an accountable party for an Epic in the [Baseline Roadmap repo](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline-roadmap).

The people and companies listed below have stepped-up to identify themselves as supporters, stakeholders, and accountable parties to advance the Baseline Protocol work.

### Project Governance Board <a id="your-project-governance-board"></a>

The project governance board \(PGB\) is organized by OASIS and is accountable for ensuring the balance and integrity of the Ethereum-Oasis initiatives, such as the Baseline Protocol.

### Specifications Steering Committee <a id="your-specifications-steering-committee"></a>

The specifications committee \(SSC\) is responsible for organizing the community and helping set functional and non-functional requirements as well as targeting use cases, industry verticals, and horizontal platforms & products. These are industry executives and influencers who can rally support for the work and help find ways to structure incentives for people to focus on key Epics and Stories in the [repo](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline). \(Note, epics and stories maintained in [Zenhub](https://www.zenhub.com/signup).\)

SSC members are seated by loose consensus of the sitting members. There is no specific maximum number of seats, and it is expected that the members will form sub-committees for topics like industry verticals.

_To be listed below, contact the_ [_TSC Chair_](community-leaders.md#your-provisional-chair) _to authorize listing your name and \(optionally\) your company, if you are accountable for at least one Epic in the baseline roadmap._
