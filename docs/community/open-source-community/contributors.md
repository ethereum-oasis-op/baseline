# Contributing

All work of the Baseline Protocol initiative is maintained publicly on a [**Github repository.**](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline)&#x20;

Full governance for contributing can be[ **found here.** ](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)****

Anyone with a Github ID can fork the repo, submit an issue, submit a PR, or participate in the further development of the work.

There are many ways to contribute, including&#x20;

* Becoming a [**technical member**](contributors.md#technical-contributors) by contributing to the technical developments and enhancements of the protocol by joining the Baseline Core Devs, and even becoming a Baseline Maintainer for advanced repo management
* Being part of the [**Standards team** ](https://www.baseline-protocol.org/get-involved/)to submit issues or pull requests for proposed updates and contributing to the discussions around open items regarding the [**specification**](broken-reference)****
* Joining the [**Outreach team**](https://www.baseline-protocol.org/get-involved/) to create content and communicate it to more potential contributors, developers, product owners, and other stakeholders

There is one other, important, way to contribute: **use the work in the Baseline Protocol to improve your own offerings**. The Baseline Protocol is not a product or platform, the pattern is _yours_ to implement.

## Code of Conduct <a href="#code-of-conduct" id="code-of-conduct"></a>

The Baseline Protocol Code of Conduct is located here

{% embed url="https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md" %}

## Technical Contributors <a href="#technical-contributors" id="technical-contributors"></a>

Technical contributors are the[ **Technical Members**](../community-leaders/maintainers.md) **** in the community.

### BLIPs

As of October 1, 2021, the Baseline Protocol organizes using[ **Baseline Improvement Proposals (BLIPs)**](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline-blips), which are managed similarly to [**Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)**](https://eips.ethereum.org/)**.**  Everyone is encouraged to submit a BLIP for an idea related to the further development or enhancement of the protocol. BLIPs can be worked on by the Baseline Core Developers or anyone interested, and even be funded through the[ **grant fund**](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline-grants) if requested and approved.&#x20;

### Work Item Management <a href="#issues-organization-and-community-sprints" id="issues-organization-and-community-sprints"></a>

The project management style varies by team, with the corresponding repo being the central location for major work items and the Google Drive storing working documents and deliverables.&#x20;

### Submitting a pull request <a href="#submitting-a-pull-request" id="submitting-a-pull-request"></a>

Follow these steps when submitting a pull request:

1. Fork the repo into your GitHub account. Read more about forking a repo on Github [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
2. Create a new branch, based on the `main` branch, with a name that concisely describes what you’re working on (ex. `add-mysql`).
3. Ensure that your changes do not cause any existing tests to fail.
4. Submit a pull request against the `main` branch.

Good practice strongly favors committing work frequently to allow Baseline Maintainers time to review. Be brave...let others see what you are working on, even if it isn't "ready."

### eCLA and iCLA <a href="#ecla-and-icla" id="ecla-and-icla"></a>

Anyone can submit a pull request and commit work to the community. In order for your work to be merged, you will need to sign the eCLA (entity contributor agreement) or iCLA (individual contributor agreement). Here are the details: [https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/projects/cla/projects-entity-cla](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/projects/cla/projects-entity-cla)​

The iCLA happens automatically when people submit a pull request, or they can access directly by going to [https://cla-assistant.io/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline](https://cla-assistant.io/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline)​

### Core Developers and Commit Rules <a href="#maintainers-and-commit-rules" id="maintainers-and-commit-rules"></a>

Merging into Main requires review by **three** [**Baseline Maintainers**](contributors.md#technical-contributors). Active Baseline Core Developers may request to become Baseline Maintainers, and the TSC may step in to resolve any requests with conflicts.

## ​Vote in the TSC Election

All contributors to the Baseline repositories that have a merged pull request and signed iCLA in the calendar year, are eligible for a vote in the yearly Technical Steering Committee election. Eligible voters will receive information for voting in September.&#x20;

## ​Contributors

The active contributors and maintainers of the Baseline Protocol repo can be found on [Github](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline/graphs/contributors).&#x20;

Note: many contributors work in clones extending the protocol for their products. These people don't necessarily show up in the Github contributors list.
