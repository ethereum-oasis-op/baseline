# Open Source Community

The number of active companies and individuals contributing to the work and using it in products and enterprise solutions is rapidly growing.

Our open source team members are the drivers of the development and adoption of the Baseline Protocol. The work is active and always open to new contributors.

### **Outreach Team**

Outreach members communicate, advocate, and educate the world on the advantages of using and contributing to the protocol. Several working groups create enablement materials, devise industry-specific use cases, and document the significant work being done in the community.

### **Standards Team**

Members of the standards team work to define and contribute to the specifications of baseline compliance. The [Standards](broken-reference/) is currently in the ratification process to become an official [Oasis Standard](https://www.oasis-open.org).

## Meetings and Meetups <a href="#meetings-and-meetups" id="meetings-and-meetups"></a>

A bridge is set up between [**Slack**](https://join.slack.com/t/ethereum-baseline/shared\_invite/zt-d6emqeci-bjzBsXBqK4D7tBTZ40AEfQ), [**Telegram**](https://t.me/baselineprotocol), and [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/NE8AYD7)**,** which allows members to send messages and read what anyone posts regardless of which platform is being used.&#x20;
