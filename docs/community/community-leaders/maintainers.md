Anyone is welcome to join the Baseline Core Developers to develop technical advancements or even just engage in technical discussions that take place.

### How to become a Baseline Maintainer? <a href="#how-to-become-a-maintainer" id="how-to-become-a-maintainer"></a>

### What do Baseline Core Developers do? <a href="#what-do-maintainers-do" id="what-do-maintainers-do"></a>

Core developers are people who take an active role in advancing the Baseline Protocol and/or related projects. They are primarily responsible for:

* Submitting or working on [**Baseline Improvement Proposals (BLIPs)** ](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline-blips)\*\*\*\*
* Contributing code or contributing to specification work in the form of PRs that are linked to open and prioritized issues
* Developing items on the [**Baseline Protocol Roadmap** ](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline/blob/main/Baseline%20Protocol%20-%202022%20Roadmap.pdf)to achieve high priority items
* Setting up and supporting infrastructure (running demos, CI systems, community projects, etc.) that further the Baseline Protocol
* Presenting the project and key technologies to the public (in-person, webinar, videos, articles, etc.)
* Identify technical resources needed for further implementation of the protocol (developer onboarding materials, tutorials, etc.)
* Working on and leading community efforts that drive adoption of the protocol

## Baseline Maintainers <a href="#how-to-become-a-maintainer" id="how-to-become-a-maintainer"></a>

Baseline Protocol Maintainers are Baseline Core Developers with advanced Github repository permissions, requiring compliance with governance for such permissions.

### How to become a Baseline Maintainer? <a href="#how-to-become-a-maintainer" id="how-to-become-a-maintainer"></a>

A Baseline Maintainer can become a Baseline Maintainer by doing the following,

* Being an active Baseline Maintainer by actively attending the bi-weekly meetings
* Making a contribution to the Baseline Protocol through [**BLIP work**](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline-blips), [**progressing the roadmap**](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline/blob/main/Baseline%20Protocol%20-%202022%20Roadmap.pdf), or other efforts
* Then completing the [**Pull\_Request\_Template** ](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline/blob/main/.github/PULL\_REQUEST\_TEMPLATE.md)in its entirety to add users Github ID to the [**Code Owners file**](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS)&#x20;
* The current Maintainers (listed Code Owners) will be assigned to review the Pull Request, and the PR will be merged once **two** Maintainers approve the request
* If the Baseline Maintainer request is denied or poses concerns, the proposer or other Baseline Core Devs can escalate to the TSC

### What is expected of Baseline Maintainers? <a href="#what-is-expected-of-maintainers" id="what-is-expected-of-maintainers"></a>

To retain Maintainer permissions and status, Baseline Maintainers are required to comply with the following,

* **Attendance Policy:** Maintainers must notify the [**'maintainer' Slack**](https://join.slack.com/t/ethereum-baseline/shared\_invite/zt-d6emqeci-bjzBsXBqK4D7tBTZ40AEfQ) group or a community leader if unable to attend. If a Maintainer misses **three** consecutive meetings without prior notice, a community member will submit a PR to remove the member's GitHub ID from the [**Code Owners File**](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS)
* **If a Maintainer is removed due to the attendance policy**, they must attend 2 Core Dev sessions, notify the group of intent to re-commit, then submit the PR to be added back to the [**Code Owners File**](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS).
* Show commitment over time by timely review of Pull Requests
* Follow branch, PR, code, project style, and testing guidelines
* Be reliable in completing issues to which they have been assigned
* Demonstrate competency in software development or specification writing
* Have a high degree of understanding of the project architecture
* Be welcoming to others in the community who are using or interested in the protocol
* Contribute in ways that substantially improve the quality of the project and the experience of people who use it

## How to stop being a Baseline Maintainer or Maintainer? <a href="#how-to-stop-being-a-maintainer" id="how-to-stop-being-a-maintainer"></a>

To step away from being a Baseline Maintainer, you can notify the other core developers you would like to relinquish your maintainer status.

What can take away your Core Dev status?

* You stop reviewing PR's, responding to messages, answering emails, and/or generally ghost the project.
* You are disrespectful towards anyone in the community and/or involved in the project.
* You are disruptive to the general process of maintaining the project, meetings, discussions, issues, or other.

Two-thirds of all current Maintainers constitute a quorum for a meeting involving a question of removal. A simple majority vote from Maintainers is required to remove a Baseline Core Dev, but the TSC may be brought in to arbitrate if the Baseline Maintainer to be removed or any other Baseline Maintainer wishes to dispute the action. See [**Governance**](../../governance/governance.md#charter-baseline-open-source-project-governance) \*\*\*\* for details.

## How do Baseline Core Developers organize? <a href="#how-maintainers-organize" id="how-maintainers-organize"></a>

### Slack Channels <a href="#slack" id="slack"></a>

The Baseline Core Developers talk in the [**'05-bl-core-devs' channel in Slack**](https://join.slack.com/t/ethereum-baseline/shared\_invite/zt-d6emqeci-bjzBsXBqK4D7tBTZ40AEfQ) \*\*\*\* to discuss updates, questions, concerns, or ideas between meetings.

The Baseline Maintainers use a private 'maintainers' channel in Slack that members with Maintainer status are added to.

### Baseline Maintainer Meetings <a href="#weekly-meetings" id="weekly-meetings"></a>

There are bi-weekly Baseline Maintainer _meetings_ where members can new or open [**Baseline Improvement Proposals (BLIPs)**](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline-blips), open repo issues and pull requests, roadmap items grant projects, and more.

Members with Maintainer status are required to join Baseline Maintainer meetings, as outlined in the terms above.
