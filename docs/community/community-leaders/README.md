# Community Leaders

## **Leadership** <a href="#leadership" id="leadership"></a>

In an openly governed, open source project, leadership is organic. Anyone interested in following the governance and leading efforts across the various teams and focuses can become a prominent leader in the community.

> The way to lead is to start something, help something, fix something...even spellcheck something! The way to lead is to get others to amplify what you are doing (best done by listening deeply to others first). The way to lead is to serve your own (and your company's) enlightened self interest. You should be able to directly see your time on this work lead to real impact for the adoption of this standard.

## Project Governance Board <a href="#your-project-governance-board" id="your-project-governance-board"></a>

The Project Governance Board (PBG) serves as a cross-section of the community, with a representative from each sponsor organization, organized by OASIS.

Representing nonprofit organizations, multinational companies, leading startups, and the stakeholder community at-large, the PGB is accountable for ensuring the balance and integrity of the Baseline Protocol. The list of PGB members can be[ found here](https://eea-oasis.github.io/managed-open-project/).

## Technical Steering Committee 2021/22 <a href="#your-technical-steering-committee" id="your-technical-steering-committee"></a>

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is accountable to the Project Governance Board for managing conflicts and the Baseline Core Dev self-organization. The TSC is elected annually by the community through an election process organized by OASIS.

The group is responsible for reviewing and approving proper use of the grant funds, to ensure funds are allocated to valuable and appropriate work. The TSC meets regularly to set technical roadmaps and ensure progress of the community toward the ubiquitous implementation of the Baseline Protocol.

On October 27, 2021, the following people were voted in as the TSC through October 2022.

## Standards Team

The standards team worked through most of 2021 to develop a world-class, technical specification for implementers of the Baseline Protocol specification. The draft is being shepherded through the OASIS process of review and amendments, culminating in becoming an official [OASIS standard](https://www.oasis-open.org/standards/). This team deserves high recognition from the community for its hard-toiling service and commitment to the Baseline Protocol.
