# Welcome

## Welcome to the Baseline Protocol Community

The Baseline Protocol is a standard that enables enterprises to synchronize complex, multiparty, business processes with privacy and without moving data from systems of record.&#x20;

There are many ways to[ **learn more**](https://www.baseline-protocol.org)**,** [**get involved**](https://www.baseline-protocol.org/get-involved/)**,** [**get 'Baselined'**](https://www.baseline-protocol.org/get-baselined/), and get value out of developing reusable components to ultimately deploy the [Baseline Protocol standard](./#the-baseline-protocol-standard) in your own offerings.&#x20;

## About the Baseline Protocol

The Baseline Protocol is the emerging standard for state synchronization across different systems of record. This applies to traditional corporate systems of record, any kind of database or [state machine](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/16447/state-machine), and even different blockchains or distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). It is particularly beneficial as a way to reduce capital expense and other overheads, while increasing operational integrity and information security when **automating and synchronizing business processes** across multiple companies.

The Baseline Protocol initiative was [announced](https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/ey-and-consensys-announce-formation-of-baseline-protocol-initiative-to-make-ethereum-mainnet-safe-and-effective-for-enterprises/) on March 4, 2020, and launched as an [OASIS Open Source Project](https://oasis-open-projects.org) on March 19, 2020, supported by fourteen founding companies. More companies joined the effort shortly thereafter and continue to do so. In 2021, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and OASIS collaborated to establish the Baseline Protocol as an [EEA Community Project](https://entethalliance.org/eeacommunityprojects/#:\~:text=The%20EEA%20Community%20Projects%2C%20formerly,API%20documentation%20under%20its%20stewardship.). There are many notable, industry leading, companies sponsoring the Baseline Protocol, [see the list of sponsors](https://www.baseline-protocol.org/become-a-sponsor/) and learn how to become a sponsor and benefits [here](https://www.baseline-protocol.org/become-a-sponsor/).

The work of the community is maintained under a [public domain license](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline/blob/main/LICENSE).

**New Contributors to the repository and standard, see** [**contribution guidelines here**](community/open-source-community/contributors.md#code-of-conduct)**.**

## The Baseline Protocol Source Code

Version 1.0 of the Baseline Protocol has been released. It is composed of a set of 6 core packages that are open-sourced, under the [CC0 1.0 Universal public domain](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline/blob/main/LICENSE) dedication.&#x20;

**You can find more about the** [**source code** ](broken-reference)****[**here**](baseline-protocol-code/packages/)**.**

## The Baseline Protocol Standard

The [Baseline Protocol Specifications ](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline-standard)were completed in September 2021 and is undergoing ratification to become an [OASIS Open Standard](https://www.oasis-open.org/standards/), available under the [CC0 1.0 Universal public domain](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline/blob/main/LICENSE) dedication.

The Baseline Protocol Standard contains three specifications - [CORE](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline-standard/tree/main/core), [API](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline-standard/tree/main/api), and [CCSM](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline-standard/tree/main/ccsm), that provide the requirements of a compliant Baseline Protocol Implementation (BPI).

**Find full details on the** [**Baseline Protocol Standard here**](broken-reference)**.**

## The Baseline Protocol Reference Implementations

A growing number of [Reference Implementations](bri/overview-of-reference-implementations.md) and demos can be [found here ](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline/tree/master/examples)to help you understand baselining and give you ideas for your implementation needs.

The first complete reference implementation, [**BRI-1**](bri/bri-1/) **** has been developed by individuals and community leaders including Provide, EY, Nethermind, ConsenSys Mesh, and others.

Today there are demos, prototypes, and production systems being developed in more places than can be tracked, and some have been submitted as public domain contributions to the community.

### Baseledger

The [Baseline Protocol standard ](broken-reference)does not stipulate the use of any particular state machine as the common frame of reference, where baseline proofs are deposited and managed in a baselined workgroup. However, Baseledger is the first public Layer-2 implementation of this service, details can be [found here](https://baseledger.net).
