# Radish34
__WARNING - RADISH34 IS DEPRECATED. IT IS HERE ONLY FOR HISTORICAL PURPOSES.__
Please refer to [BRI-1](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline/tree/master/examples/bri-1/base-example) or check out the [reference implementations](https://docs.baseline-protocol.org/bri/overview-of-reference-implementations) to get an idea of how to implement the baseline protocol.

__Radish34__ is a product procurement application that utilizes the __Baseline Protocol__ to gain unprecedented data integrity while maintaining privacy and security for its users.

Disclaimer: This implementation is a demo, and production aspects of key management, wallet management, cloud hosting, integration to other third party tools and performance optimization are left out of scope to drive adoption and present a base set of tools for the community to provide inputs and take this further.

## Prerequisites to run the demo

Windows 10 users [should follow some initial setup instructions](windows_setup.md) first.

1. Install [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac), or
    [Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows) (Windows users [using WSL](windows_setup.md) can skip this step).
    - It's recommended that you allocate 12.5GB of RAM in Docker (see 'Troubleshooting').
1. MacOS development environment (Catalina or later - 10.15.X). Note: It is possible it works in other environments/versions of MacOS
1. NodeJS version 11.15 installed (or use of NVM is recommended)
1. Use npm to install yarn `npm install -g yarn`

## Quickstart

A `Makefile` has been included for convenience; most of its targets wrap `npm` and `docker` commands.

Just want to get the __Baseline Protocol__ running locally? The following sequence will build the monorepo, start the __Baseline Protocol__ stack locally, deploy contracts and run the full test suite. *Note: this typically takes at least 20 minutes to complete.
```
make && make start && make test
```
> Note: The file `./env.dev.env` contains environment variables that allow you to select between configurable options. For example, to speed up testing you can use "dummy" ZKP circuits (`createDummyMSA` and `createDummyPO`) instead of the `createMSA` and `createPO` by setting `BASELINE_ZKP_MODE="1"`. This shortens the integration test time significantly because the proof generation for the "dummy" circuits is trivial.

### The demo UI

After running the above (`make test` optional) you can view the Radish34 demo by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Here are the targets currently exposed by the `Makefile`:

- `make`: Alias for `make build`
- `make build`: Build all modules within the monorepo.
- `make build-containers`: Dockerize all modules within the monorepo.
- `make clean`: Reclaim disk used by all modules (i.e. `node_modules/`) and the local docker environment. This effectively uninstalls your local __Baseline__ environment and will require building from scratch.
- `make contracts`: Compile the Solidity contracts.
- `make deploy-contracts`: Deploy the Solidity contracts. Requires the stack to be running.
- `make npm-install`: `npm i` wrapper for all modules in the monorepo.
- `make start`: Start the full __Baseline__ stack. Requires `docker` service to be running with at least 12 GB RAM allocation.
- `make stop`: Stop the running __Baseline__ stack.
- `make system-check`: Verify that `docker` is configured properly.
- `make restart`: Stop and start the `docker` stack.
- `make reset`: Clean the docker environment by pruning the docker networks and volumes.
- `make test`: Run the full test suite. Requires the stack to be running.
- `make zk-circuits`: Perform zk-SNARK trusted setups for circuits contained within `zkp/circuits`

## Detailed Setup

The steps below illustrate the individual steps, that can be viewed as the breakdown of the `make` scripts.

1. As part of the development environment, we assume a procurement use-case with three users: (1) buyer and (2) supplier organizations.
2. Run `make npm-install`. ** This takes about 6 minutes to clean install npm packages in root and all sub directories **
3. Run `docker-compose build` to create the latest versions of the docker containers. ** Only do this the first time or when service source code is changed **. ** This takes about 40 minutes for a fresh build **
4. Run `npm run setup-circuits` to perform zk-SNARK trusted setups for the circuits that are contained in the `/zkp/circuits`. ** This takes about 5-10 minutes to complete **

5. Run `npm run build:contracts` to compile the smart contracts in `contracts/contracts` to JSON files (containing ABI and Bytecode key value pairs) in the `contracts/artifacts` folder needed for deployment. ** This takes less than 15 seconds to run **
6. Run `npm run deploy` to deploy the smart contracts. ** This takes about 2 minutes **
    - This docker container first deploys both the Registry contract and the OrgRegistry contract.
    - Then it registers (1) Buyer and (2) Supplier organizations. The corresponding `/config/config-${role}.json` files are updated with the newly deployed contract addresses.
    - The goal of deployment is to initialize the Radish34 system by pre-registering a buyer and 2 suppliers with an `OrgRegistry` smart contract, which holds the organization metadata to thus enable any ongoing procurement operations.
    - Essentially the deployment is based on deploying an `ERC1820Registry` client called the `Registrar`, followed by registering an interface for `OrgRegistry` with the `ERC1820Registry`, then registering the roles of the buyer and supplier with the `OrgRegistry`
    - In addition, the contracts that are necessary for privacy management, `Shield` and `Verifier` contract are deployed to the network
    - Any changes to the config files are updated in the individual db instances `mongo-${role}`

7. Run `docker-compose up -d && docker-compose restart`
   - This will reinstate and restart all `radish` containers
   - Wait about 10 seconds to give containers time to complete their initialization routines
   - Run `docker-compose logs -f {SERVICE_NAME}` to check the logs of specific containers. Key ones to watch are api-{role} and ui. For example: `docker-compose logs -f api-buyer api-supplier1 api-supplier2 ui`

9. Within about 5 minutes, UI is loaded on `http://localhost:3000` on your local browser

## Collection of Log Commands

`docker-compose logs -f ui`  
`docker-compose logs -f zkp`
`docker-compose logs -f api-buyer`  
`docker-compose logs -f api-supplier1`
`docker-compose logs -f api-supplier2`
`docker-compose logs -f messenger-buyer`
`docker-compose logs -f messenger-supplier1`
`docker-compose logs -f messenger-supplier2`       
`docker-compose logs -f mongo-buyer`
`docker-compose logs -f mongo-supplier1`
`docker-compose logs -f mongo-supplier2`  
`docker-compose logs -f geth-node`   
`docker-compose logs -f geth-miner1`  
`docker-compose logs -f geth-miner2`  
`docker-compose logs -f geth-bootnode`

Access docker container via `docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash` and read logs in `/app/logs` via `cat <log_name>`.

## Troubleshooting

1. If you get errors during the `npm i` step, please ensure that you are running node version `11`. The `nvm` (node version manager) tool allows you to easily switch between versions:
```
nvm install 11
nvm use 11
```

2. Restart the test environment
   - Run `docker-compose down` to stop containers
   - Run this command to give the docker command a clean slate: `docker volume prune -f && echo volume pruned && docker system prune -f && echo system pruned && docker network prune -f && echo network pruned`
   - In some cases, due to stale images application may have build issues owing to existing images and packages that were a part of those builds. To get around such issues, run `docker-compose build --no-cache` to run a clean re-build of the docker images
   - Run through the 'steps to start the application' in __Development/Test Environment__
3. Increasing resource allocation for Docker
   - During set up, `npm run setup-circuits`, there are cases where the setup instruction might fail, and the logs of the `zkp` container (`docker-compose logs -f zkp`) throws babel compilation errors. This is due to the memory consumption needed for running the compute intensive set up process. In these cases, it is recommended to toggle memory and CPU cores consumption
   - Consider these steps if you are running many of the `radish` containers and your PC is bogged down
   - Check the memory usage by running `docker stats`
   - If the containers are using most of the RAM allocated to Docker, you can increase RAM available to Docker by clicking the Docker Desktop icon in the task bar. Choose `Preferences --> Advanced`, then increase `Memory` to a recommended `12.5GiB` (default is `2.0GiB`). Although not required in all cases, it is recommended to increase the swap memory to 4GB and CPU cores to 8 on Docker Preferences/Settings. It is also worth noting that due to Docker overhead (<0.5GB), you will not get to use 100% of the RAM allocated to Docker to run Baseline.
4. Running tests
   - In some cases, while running the test suite `npm run test` there could be a socket hang up error. This is potentially due to race conditions across the different containers for the API services. To resolve this issue run `docker-compose restart api-buyer api-supplier1 api-supplier2` to get rid of errors while running the test suite.

1. Check health of the containers. Running `docker ps` will show all the containers for the Radish34 demo and if they are healthy or not. To inspect the health check results of a container run the following `docker inspect --format='{{json .State.Health}}' your-container-name`

### Front-end Environment

1. When the above setup is run successfully, the UI is ready at `http://localhost:3000`
2. Typically, this process takes about a minute to two. Successful loading of UI at the url can be inspected based on the logs of the `ui` container.
