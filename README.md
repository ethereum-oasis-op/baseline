# Welcome

## Welcome to the Baseline Community

The Baseline Protocol is a standard that enables enterprises to synchronize complex, multiparty, business processes with privacy and without moving data from systems of record.&#x20;

There are many ways to[ **learn more**](https://www.baseline-protocol.org)**,** [**get involved**](https://www.baseline-protocol.org/get-involved/)**,** [**get 'Baselined'**](https://www.baseline-protocol.org/get-baselined/), and get value out of developing reusable components to ultimately deploy the [Baseline Protocol standard](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline-standard) in your own offerings.&#x20;

## New Community Focus

After the completion of the Baseline Protocol Standard and the reference implementation BRI-3, the community experienced a decline in activity. To revitalize and refocus the community, the remaining members obtained a grant from the EU Trustchain to build interoperability tests and demonstrate the protocol's potential in real-world scenarios.

The community now focuses on financial inclusion and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) as primary drivers. This pivot is driven by the recognition that the Baseline Protocol can play a crucial role in addressing significant global challenges, such as bridging the SME financing gap in developing regions and promoting sustainable business practices.

### Rationale for the Pivot

1. **Financial Inclusion**: The Baseline Protocol Interoperability Demo showcases a use-case with potentially huge economic impact - bridging the SME financing gap in developing regions. By enabling efficient and verifiable data exchange processes, the protocol can help small-scale invoice financing operations attract large debt providers, aggregate fragmented portfolios across jurisdictions, and standardize origination procedures. This can lead to safer and more efficient lending practices, ultimately fostering economic growth and financial inclusion.

2. **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)**: The community recognizes the importance of ESG factors in modern business practices. By focusing on ESG, the Baseline Protocol can help organizations automate and synchronize business processes in a way that promotes transparency, accountability, and sustainability. This aligns with the growing demand for businesses to adopt responsible practices that benefit society and the environment.

The community's brand statement, "Baseline Inside," reflects this renewed focus on leveraging the Baseline Protocol to drive positive change in financial inclusion and ESG.

## About Baseline

The Baseline Protocol is the global standard for state synchronization across different systems of record. This applies to traditional corporate systems of record, any kind of database or [state machine](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/16447/state-machine), and even different blockchains or distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). It is particularly beneficial as a way to reduce capital expense and other overheads, while increasing operational integrity and information security when **automating and synchronizing business processes** across multiple companies.

The Baseline Protocol initiative was [announced](https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/ey-and-consensys-announce-formation-of-baseline-protocol-initiative-to-make-ethereum-mainnet-safe-and-effective-for-enterprises/) on March 4, 2020, and launched as an [OASIS Open Source Project](https://oasis-open-projects.org) on March 19, 2020, supported by fourteen founding companies. More companies joined the effort shortly thereafter and continue to do so. In 2021, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and OASIS collaborated to establish the Baseline Protocol as an [EEA Community Project](https://entethalliance.org/eeacommunityprojects/#:\~:text=The%20EEA%20Community%20Projects%2C%20formerly,API%20documentation%20under%20its%20stewardship.).

## The Baseline Protocol Source Code

Version 1.0 of the Baseline Protocol has been released. It is composed of a set of 6 core packages that are open-sourced, under the [CC0 1.0 Universal public domain](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline/blob/main/LICENSE) dedication.&#x20;

**You can find more about the** **source code** [**here**](docs/baseline-protocol-code/packages/)**.**

## The Baseline Protocol Standard

The [Baseline Protocol Specifications ](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline-standard) were completed in September 2021 and is undergoing ratification to become an [OASIS Open Standard](https://www.oasis-open.org/standards/), available under the [CC0 1.0 Universal public domain](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline/blob/main/LICENSE) dedication.

The Baseline Protocol Standard contains three specifications - [CORE](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline-standard/tree/main/core), [API](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline-standard/tree/main/api), and [CCSM](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline-standard/tree/main/ccsm), that provide the requirements of a compliant Baseline Protocol Implementation (BPI).

## The Baseline Protocol Reference Implementations

A growing number of [Baseline Protocol Reference Implementations](docs/bri/overview-of-reference-implementations.md), along with [demonstrations and examples]https://github.com/ethereum-oasis-op/baseline/tree/master/examples) are available to help you understand baselining and give you ideas for your implementation needs.

## Baseline Protocol Interoperability Demo based on an EU Trustchain grant

The Baseline Protocol Interoperability Demo focuses on a use-case with potentially huge economic impact - bridging the SME financing gap in the developing regions. The scenario involves multiple stakeholders including invoice financing companies, large debt providers, and regulatory bodies, participating in what should be an efficient and verifiable data exchange process that would allow the debt providers to safely and efficiently lend money to the invoice financing companies.

The current financing landscape faces significant challenges due to:
- Small-scale invoice financing operations unable to attract large debt providers
- Fragmented portfolios across jurisdictions
- Non-standardized origination procedures
- Complex regulatory requirements

The challenge is to develop a solution that enables portfolio aggregation while ensuring standardized origination processes and independent verification capabilities. The proposed approach leverages a modular software protocol to achieve these objectives while maintaining process integrity across all participating entities.
