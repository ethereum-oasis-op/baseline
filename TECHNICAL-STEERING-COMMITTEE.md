The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is accountable to the Project Governance Board for managing conflicts and the Baseline Core Dev self-organization. The TSC is elected annually by the community through an election process organized by OASIS.

The group is responsible for reviewing and approving proper use of the grant funds, to ensure funds are allocated to valuable and appropriate work. The TSC meets regularly to set technical roadmaps and ensure progress of the community toward the ubiquitous implementation of the Baseline Protocol.

The following people were elected to serve on the Baseline TSC from November 2023 to November 2024 (in alphabetical order):

* Ryan Fleischman
* Andreas Freund
* Kartheek Solipuram
* Ognjen Kurtic
* Sonal Patel

The new TSC is currently being reconstituted.
