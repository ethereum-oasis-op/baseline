The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is accountable to the Project Governance Board for managing conflicts and the Baseline Core Dev self-organization. The TSC is elected annually by the community through an election process organized by OASIS.

The group is responsible for reviewing and approving proper use of the grant funds, to ensure funds are allocated to valuable and appropriate work. The TSC meets regularly to set technical roadmaps and ensure progress of the community toward the ubiquitous implementation of the Baseline Protocol.

* Andreas Freund
